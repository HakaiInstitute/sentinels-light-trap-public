#==== FORMATTED COUNT DATA =====================================================

# BC Count Data - all years available
counts22 <- read_csv("data/2022/2022_CountData_QC.csv")
counts23 <- read_csv("data/2023/2023_CountData_QC.csv")
counts24 <- read_csv("data/2024/2024_CountData_QC.csv")
counts24 <- select(counts24, -Battery, -submissionid, -Comments, -...28) #remove columns from rough dataset that 
                                        #don't match

#combine them
counts_all <- rbind(counts22, counts23, counts24)

###Bring in Stations data to get lats and longs
stations <- read.csv("data/Master_Stations.csv") %>% 
  dplyr::select( Site = Site, Lat, Lon)

#join datasets, now all entries have an associated lat and long
counts_master <- merge(counts_all,stations,by=c("Site"))


#==== QAQC DETERMINATIONS ======================================================

# MET - missing metadata (hours or nights fished)
# BAT - trap fished for over 25 hours
# HRS - timer on/off times were off by 1+ hr
# DNF - trap did not fish properly
# INC - trap did not fish for over 25% of nights in any given month from 
# ERR - protocols not followed properly and counts likely not accurate
#       Apr 15 to Sep 1

# These can be assigned using code Assign_QAQC.R before importing here

# For annual reports and Hakai Data Catalogue, remove all MET, DNF, ERR, & INC
# entries:
counts_QC <- counts_master %>%  filter(Error_Code== "None" | Error_Code== "HRS" 
                                        | Error_Code == "BAT" | Error_Code == "SUB")
###note, here I added teh "SUB" error code so that the Whaler Bay subsampled 
#numbers from late June/early July 2024 would still be included in the fall gathering
#graphs. Will decide what to do with these problematic data at a later date 


##Create dataframe w/ removed entries to keep track
counts_removed <- counts_master %>% filter (Error_Code =="DNF" | 
                                            Error_Code =="MET" |
                                            Error_Code == "ERR" | 
                                            Error_Code == "INC")


#====FORMATED MEASUREMENT DATA =================================================
