# sentinels-light-trap

Repository for Hakai's Sentinels of Change light trap network

## Summary

Since 2022, a network of community partners has been monitoring larval Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister) using light traps along the coast of British Columbia as part of the Hakai Institute-led Sentinels of Change project. This project aims to investigate patterns of larval dispersal, population and recruitment dynamics, and whether larval abundance can serve as a tool for managers to forecast adult crab abundance years in advance. Initially inspired by the [Pacific Northwest Crab Research Group (PCRG)](https://www.pnwcrab.com/), the project works collaborativly with a diverse network of community partners, of which a full list can be found on the [Sentinels of Change website](https://sentinels.hakai.org/). See the [master reference station list](data/Master_Stations.csv) for a the exact location of the different partners.

## Methods

From April 15th to September 1st light traps are deployed off floating docks within coastal communities around British Columbia. The trap lights turn on every night between sunset and sunrise and are checked every two days by community partners. The number of Dungeness crab megalopae and juvenile instars are counted and photos are taken to measure larvae using an image analysis software. Partners submit data via a digital form that is promptly QCed for instant feedback. Each light trap has a corresponding HOBO Onset TidbiT MX2203 temperature loggers that are deployed near the trap at 0.5m. The loggers are programmed to record water temperature every 10 minutes during the entire sampling season.
